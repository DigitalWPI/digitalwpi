The goal of this project was to assist the museum in the creation of educational resources to help schools fulfill a part of the Citizenship Curriculum, primarily Key Stages 3 and 4. Through extensive research, interviews, workshops, and a review of curricular materials on homelessness, the team developed a set of deliverables that included new web pages, a school database, a good practice guide and a set of lesson plans. Educating students about homelessness is one way to increase awareness about homelessness and instill the ideas of acceptance and tolerance in generations to come."

            "Urban wilds are crucial areas of natural land that are being lost to development. This project was designed to overcome the lack of communication and information currently undermining Boston's protective attempts in order to minimize further loss. Data collected through visiting unprotected wilds was used to determine each wild's importance and recorded in a database that included images and current ownership information for each wild, thus creating a source of centralized information."
