            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <div class="questions">
                <p><strong>Is every WPI student project and dissertation in Digital WPI?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, but only since 2003 for graduate work and 2007 for undergraduate work. Graduate theses and dissertations before 2003 can be found in the library in print. Undergraduate projects before 2007 are only selectively available: the library digitized print copies of IQPs and MQPs from 2002-2007, but most earlier IQPs and MQPs were returned to the departments and may not have been retained. A few IQPs and MQPs are available in print in the library’s Archives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questions">
                    <p><strong>Why can't I see the full text of a specific student project, thesis, or dissertation?</strong></p>
                    <p>Full-text access to some student projects is restricted to the WPI community, usually because the project was digitized before WPI began requiring digital submission of projects. If you are interested in accessing a project that is restricted to the WPI community, please contact <%= mail_to "digitalwpi@wpi.edu" %>.</p>
                    <p>For some projects, theses, and dissertations, concerns about confidentiality or intellectual property have led the author and their advisor to choose to restrict access to the full text, for a limited period of time of up to 5 years (embargo).  The date the material will be made fully available is provided.  If you are interested in accessing a student work that is embargoed, please contact <%= mail_to "digitalwpi@wpi.edu" %>.</p>
                    <p>If you have questions about the availability of student work that you don’t find in Digital WPI, please contact us at <%= mail_to "digitalwpi@wpi.edu" %>.</p>

            <div class="questions">
                    <p><strong>How do I extend an embargo on my thesis/dissertation/IQP/MQP that is currently in Digital WPI?</strong></p>
                    <p>For graduate research, the decision to extend an embargo resides with advisors, departments, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Contact the <%= link_to "Office of Graduate Studies", "https://www.wpi.edu/academics/graduate" %> with your request.</p>
                    <p>For undergraduate research, the decision to extend an embargo resides with advisors, departments, and the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Contact the <%= link_to "Office of Undergraduate Studies", "https://www.wpi.edu/academics/undergraduate" %> with your request.</p>

            <div class="questions">
                    <p><strong>Does Digital WPI have a policy for removing content?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>How do I get permission to use a resource from Digital WPI in another publication, on another website, or elsewhere?</strong></p>
                    <p>Look for the copyright or rights statement associated with the resource for guidance on how you can reuse an item.

                    <p><strong>What platform does Digital WPI use?</strong></p>
                    <p>Digital WPI uses <%= link_to "Hyrax", "https://hyrax.samvera.org/about/" %>, a community-supported repository front end that uses the Samvera framework, built on top of the Fedora repository for digital asset management and using Apache Solr for searching and indexing. </p>

            <div class="questions">
                    <p><strong>When did this project start?</strong></p>
                    <p>Development work on the current Digital WPI platform began in 2018. This version of Digital WPI using the Hyrax platform replaces several older digital platforms. Data from these older platforms is being migrated to Digital WPI.</p>
